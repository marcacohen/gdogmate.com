Greetings!!  My name is Kimberly and I’m an American who moved to London 3 years ago, bringing 
with me my 16-year- old daughter and my 10-year-old mixed breed dog Meiko. Animals are a passion
of mine, having previously worked as a veterinarian in the U.S.  I’ve also been a vegetarian for
more than 30 years, primarily because of my views on animal welfare and my concerns for the 
ethical treatment of all living things.  My friend and business partner, Sally, and I are
dedicated to providing your pooch with the same loving care that we would give to our own pets.
We look forward to meeting you and your pup and discussing your individual dog walking needs.
G'day from g'dog mate!

Hello, my name is Sally and I was born in the Peak District and my first best friend was Morgan, my childhood labrador (he took me for a walk!). I've many fond memories of long walks with Morgan around the Derbyshire Dales, before emigrating to Australia, where I grew up with cats, dogs, horses, sheep and even a pet Blue Tongue Lizard!

I moved back to the UK in 1995 and rescued a lovely little rescue dog from Battersea, whom I named Charlie. I have not found a job more rewarding than spending my time caring for and walking four-legged friends, hence starting up G'Dog Mate with my friend Kimberly.
